# Progress: AI Trip Planner

## Current Status (as of 2025-04-11 - Post Supabase Feedback Integration)

*   **Phase:** Implemented Supabase integration for storing user feedback. Memory Bank updated. Focus shifts towards integrating existing LLM provider code.
*   **Backend:** Core components implemented in Python using FastAPI.
    *   API endpoints exist for recommendations, categories, session management, conversational itinerary planning (`/api/py/itinerary-details-conversation`), and feedback submission (`/api/py/feedback`).
    *   **LLM Interaction:** Currently uses the `openai` library directly (`AsyncOpenAI` client). Code for a flexible LLM provider abstraction (supporting OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic via Strategy Pattern) exists in `agent/llm_providers/` but is **not integrated** into the main application flow.
    *   Integration with Google Places API is functional.
    *   **Travel Time Caching:** Implemented Redis caching for Google Maps travel time results via `get_travel_time_matrix_cached` in `agent/utils/travel_time.py`. `TripAgent` now uses this cached function.
    *   Persistent server-side session management implemented using Redis (`SessionManager`). Sessions store conversation history, user requirements, and itinerary drafts.
    *   Primary itinerary generation method confirmed as `get_itinerary_draft` (LLM + tool based). The `get_itinerary_with_greedy_scheduler` method is considered secondary/experimental.
*   **Frontend:** Basic Gradio UI (`gradio_app.py`) exists.
    *   Provides initial form for trip details.
    *   Includes chat interface and itinerary display (Markdown).
    *   Connects to backend API for conversation and itinerary updates.
    *   Manages `session_id`.
    *   Includes UI elements for feedback (buttons) which are now **connected to the backend `/api/py/feedback` endpoint**.
*   **Feedback Storage:** User feedback (like/dislike/comment), along with associated session data (requirements, conversation, itinerary), is stored in a Supabase `feedback` table.
*   **Documentation:** Memory Bank updated to reflect the Supabase feedback integration.

## What Works (Based on Code & Discussion)

*   FastAPI server runs and exposes endpoints.
*   API request/response validation using Pydantic.
*   **Direct OpenAI Interaction:** `TripAgent` successfully interacts with the OpenAI API (`gpt-4o`) for core tasks.
*   **(Designed) LLM Provider Abstraction Code:** Code exists in `agent/llm_providers/` for a flexible abstraction (interface, implementations for OpenAI/Gemini/Anthropic, factory), but it is **not currently integrated or used**.
*   Fetching categories via LLM (using direct OpenAI calls).
*   Generating attraction recommendations using LLM + Google Places API.
*   Proxying Google Place images.
*   Persistent session management via Redis (create, get, update, delete, expire).
*   **Travel Time Caching:** Caching Google Maps API results in Redis to reduce latency and API calls.
*   Storing trip requirements and conversation history in session.
*   Multi-turn conversational flow for gathering user requirements via LLM and tools.
*   Generating a structured itinerary draft via LLM and a travel time tool (`get_itinerary_draft`).
*   Basic Gradio UI interaction:
    *   Submitting initial trip details via form.
    *   Sending/receiving messages via chat interface.
    *   Displaying the generated itinerary in Markdown format.
    *   Submitting itinerary feedback (like/dislike/comment) via UI buttons/textbox, which calls the backend API to store data in Supabase.

## What's Left to Build / Refine

*   **LLM Provider Integration (High Priority):**
    *   **Integrate Existing Code:** Refactor `TripAgent` and `TripAgentServer` to use the existing `agent/llm_providers/` code (Strategy/Factory patterns).
    *   **Install Dependencies:** Install `google-generativeai` and `anthropic` libraries *when* integrating.
    *   **Configure Environment:** Set up environment variables (`LLM_PROVIDER`, API keys, model names) for the desired provider *after* integration.
    *   **Test Integration:** Test the integrated providers with actual API keys *after* integration.
*   **Configure Supabase Environment:** Ensure `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` are set in the `.env` file or environment.
*   **Backend Enhancements:**
    *   (Optional) Refactor/remove `greedy_scheduler` code if confirmed deprecated.
*   **Testing:** Expand unit and integration tests, especially for the LLM provider integration (once done) and Supabase interactions.
*   **Deployment Configuration:** Finalize and test deployment configurations (Heroku/Docker with Redis and Supabase env vars).
*   **Error Handling:** Enhance robustness for external API/LLM/Redis/Supabase failures, including better error display in Gradio.
*   **Cost/Rate Limit Management:** Implement strategies if necessary.
*   **(UI Polish):** Minor improvements to Gradio UI (e.g., better itinerary formatting if needed, clearer feedback confirmation).

## Known Issues / Ambiguities (Resolved/Clarified)

*   Role of `get_itinerary_with_greedy_scheduler`: Confirmed as secondary to `get_itinerary_draft`.
*   **LLM Provider Status:** Code for flexible abstraction (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) **exists** but is **not currently integrated or used**. The application currently uses OpenAI directly.
*   Session Persistence: Confirmed Redis is used and provides persistence.
*   Gradio Frontend Status: Confirmed basic UI exists, feedback integration is **implemented** (UI -> Backend -> Supabase).
*   Debugger Breakpoint: Fixed a debugger breakpoint issue in `gradio_app.py`.

## Evolution of Project Decisions (Reflecting Code Review)

*   **Created LLM Provider Abstraction Code:** Code for a flexible architecture (supporting OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) was created in `agent/llm_providers/`.
*   **Designed Strategy Pattern:** The Strategy Pattern was designed to decouple LLM logic, but it is **not yet applied** in the active `TripAgent` or `TripAgentServer`.
*   **Designed Standardized Responses:** Standardized response models were created within the provider code, but are not currently used by the main agent.
*   **Designed Environment-Based Configuration:** Environment variable configuration for provider switching was designed as part of the abstraction, but is not active.
*   **Fixed Gradio App Issue:** Removed a debugger breakpoint from `gradio_app.py`.
*   **Memory Bank Updated:** Documentation updated to align with the actual codebase state after review and Supabase integration.
*   **Implemented Travel Time Caching:** Added `get_travel_time_matrix_cached` and integrated it into `TripAgent` to use Redis for caching Google Maps API results.
*   **Implemented Feedback Loop:** Added backend endpoint (`/api/py/feedback`), Supabase client utility, and integrated Gradio UI to store user feedback in Supabase.
